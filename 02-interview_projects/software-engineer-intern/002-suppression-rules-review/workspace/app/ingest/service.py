"""Turn one scan's raw plugin results into findings (architecture section 2, step 4).

Called by the worker pipeline inside the scan job's transaction, with only the
results of the plugins that completed. Flushes, never commits: findings,
finding events and outbox rows commit together with the scan status.

Two scans of the same asset ingesting at the same moment can both try to
insert a new fingerprint; the ``(tenant_id, fingerprint)`` unique constraint
then fails the later job, whose retry sees the row and treats it as seen.
