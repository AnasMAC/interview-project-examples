# On-call runbook

Owner: Ravi Menon. Audience: whoever holds the pager. Commands assume the
compose stack; in production replace `docker compose run --rm api` with the
equivalent one-off task. Postgres is the only state that matters: Redis holds
rate-limit counters and can be flushed at will.

## First look

```sh
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8080/healthz          # {"status": "ok", "db": true}
make logs SERVICE=worker                         # JSON lines; filter on "msg"
make psql
```

Useful log events: `job.claimed`, `job.retry_scheduled`, `job.dead`,
`job.reaped`, `scan.started`, `scan.completed`, `webhook.delivered`,
`webhook.retry_scheduled`, `webhook.dead`. Every line of a job carries `job_id`; scan lines carry
`scan_id` and `tenant_id`.

Queue overview:

```sql
SELECT kind, status, count(*), min(run_after) AS oldest_due
FROM jobs WHERE status <> 'done' GROUP BY 1, 2 ORDER BY 1, 2;
```

A healthy queue has almost nothing `queued` with `run_after` in the past and
nothing `running` for longer than a few minutes.

## Stuck jobs

**Symptom.** Scans stay `queued` or `running`; customers ask why last night's
scan has no results.

1. Is a worker alive? `docker compose ps worker`, then look for recent
   `job.claimed` lines. If the worker is down, start it; queued jobs are
   picked up in order of `run_after`.
2. Find running jobs with an old heartbeat:

   ```sql
   SELECT id, kind, payload, attempts, locked_by, heartbeat_at, now() - heartbeat_at AS silent
   FROM jobs WHERE status = 'running' ORDER BY heartbeat_at;
   ```

3. The **reaper** runs at the top of every worker loop. A `running` job whose
   `heartbeat_at` is older than `TW_WORKER_STALE_AFTER_S` (60 s) goes back to
   `failed` with a backoff, or to `dead` when it has used `max_attempts`. You
   normally do not need to touch these rows: wait one loop and check again.
4. Many jobs reaped in a row usually mean the worker is being killed mid-job
   (OOM, deploy) or a plugin hangs past its timeout. Check the worker's memory
   and `plugin.timeout` lines before replaying anything.

Do not set `status = 'queued'` by hand on a `running` job whose worker might
still be alive: two workers would run the same scan.

## Dead jobs and replay-job

A job is `dead` after `max_attempts` (5) failed claims. For a `scan.run` job
the scan is marked `failed` and a `scan.failed` webhook goes out.

```sql
SELECT id, kind, payload, attempts, last_error, finished_at
FROM jobs WHERE status = 'dead' ORDER BY finished_at DESC LIMIT 20;
```

Fix the cause first (the `last_error` and the worker logs around
`finished_at`), then replay:

```sh
docker compose run --rm api python -m app.cli replay-job 4312          # dry run: prints the job
docker compose run --rm api python -m app.cli replay-job 4312 --yes    # requeue
```

`replay-job` accepts only `dead` or `failed` jobs. It sets the job back to
`queued` with `attempts = 0` and `run_after = now`, clears the lock, and keeps
`last_error` for the record. For a `scan.run` job whose scan is `failed`, the
scan goes back to `queued` with its error cleared, so the customer sees it run
again. It refuses when the scan is `completed` or `cancelled`. There is no bulk
mode; replay jobs one at a time and watch the first one finish.

## Webhook backlog

**Symptom.** A customer reports missing or late webhooks.

```sql
SELECT w.tenant_id, w.url, o.status, count(*), min(o.next_attempt_at), max(o.attempts)
FROM outbox o JOIN webhooks w ON w.id = o.webhook_id
WHERE o.status IN ('pending', 'failed', 'dead') GROUP BY 1, 2, 3 ORDER BY 4 DESC;
```

- `failed` rows with rising `attempts`: the receiver is down or answering
  non-2xx. `last_error` has the status code. Retries back off up to
  `TW_WEBHOOK_MAX_ATTEMPTS` (8) before the row goes `dead`. Tell the customer
  (Hugo Lefèvre handles the contact); nothing to do on our side.
- `pending` rows piling up with `next_attempt_at` in the past: the worker is
  not pumping the outbox. The pump runs in the worker loop, so this is the
  stuck-worker case above.
- `dead` rows are not retried. Once the receiver is fixed and the customer
  wants the events, move them back explicitly and keep the list in the
  incident notes:

  ```sql
  UPDATE outbox SET status = 'pending', attempts = 0, next_attempt_at = now(), last_error = NULL
  WHERE webhook_id = 17 AND status = 'dead' AND created_at > '2026-10-12';
  ```

Receivers deduplicate on `X-Tidewright-Delivery`, so a redelivery is safe. In
development all webhooks point at `mockhook`; its deliveries are in
`var/mockhook/deliveries.jsonl`.

## Pruning

Delivered outbox rows and `done` jobs are kept for 30 days for support
questions, then deleted:

```sh
docker compose run --rm api python -m app.cli prune --days 30 --dry-run
docker compose run --rm api python -m app.cli prune --days 30
```

Dead jobs and undelivered outbox rows are never pruned; they need a decision.

## Time zones and DST

Schedules are evaluated on the tenant's wall clock (`tenants.timezone`), and
each scheduled scan records the UTC instant of its slot in
`scans.scheduled_slot`. Around a DST change a local time can happen twice
(clocks go back) or not at all (clocks go forward), so the first nights after
a transition deserve a look:

```sql
SELECT p.name, s.asset_id, s.scheduled_slot, count(*)
FROM scans s JOIN scan_profiles p ON p.id = s.profile_id
WHERE s.trigger = 'schedule' AND s.requested_at > now() - interval '3 days'
GROUP BY 1, 2, 3 ORDER BY 3;
```

Upcoming transitions for current customers: Lumen Retail (Australia/Sydney)
moved forward on 2026-10-04, Acme Shipping (Europe/Amsterdam) moves back on
2026-10-25, Northpeak Health (America/Chicago) on 2026-11-01. Scheduler logs
(`scheduler.tick`, `scheduler.scan_planned`) show what each tick planned.

## Slow findings list or exports

**Symptom.** A large tenant reports that the findings page or a CSV export is
slow, or a `report.generate` job keeps retrying.

1. Look at what the database is doing while it happens:

   ```sql
   SELECT pid, now() - query_start AS running, state, left(query, 80)
   FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE datname = 'tidewright' AND state <> 'idle'
   ORDER BY running DESC;
   ```

2. Dashboards that page with a small `limit` make many round trips. Raising
   `TW_PAGE_LIMIT_MAX` (default 500) on the api lets a client fetch more per
   request; we set it to 2000 for Acme during their June onboarding and the
   complaints stopped. Restart the api after changing it.
3. If one tenant's dashboard keeps reloading the same pages, the plan is to
   cache list pages per tenant in Redis for a minute (not built yet; talk to
   Tomasz Wrona).
4. Reports are generated by the worker; a failed `report.generate` job shows
   up in the queue overview above and can be replayed like any other job.
